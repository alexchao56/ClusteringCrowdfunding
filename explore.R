#Sort posts by perk_id
#Do a rudimentay graph of the various clusters. See which is the most/least frequent perk_id
#Assume that perk_id is coded from basic(low) to complex(high)
#Identify the outliers

#Sort posts by prices
#Compare to perk_id. Would expect higher prices to correspond to a higher perk_id


#Use cosine similarity (Levenshtein library in python)
#Calculate a sentiment score for each comment.
#Look up NLP libraries for R, or change to python
#Iterate through comments calculating the sentiment for each
#Sort again by sentiment scores. See which perk_id or price gets the highest score
#Can hopefully identify the ones that are the most highly favored

#Do a word frequency count on the perk descriptions. Expect the word "free" to be the most common
#but what will be the next 10 most common words?

### For Comments Dataset ###

#Identify which campaigns generated the most number of comments
#Calculate sentiment of comments. Which campaigns correspond to highest scored sentiment
