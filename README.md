ClusteringCrowdfunding
======================

To do:
* Find sentiment of comments
* Build a naive classifier of successful/unsuccessful campaigns
* Viusalize
** Distinguish between successful/unsuccessful campaigns. What do successful ones look like? Explore different stats plots
** visualize the data in a way that might reveal patterns
** account for outliers
** define degrees of failure. Features of successful campaigns and of campaigns with different degrees of failure that would allow you to more exactly discover which features are most important for success
** It might be interesting to look at the language used to pitch the campaign
** Ratio of visual content to non visual content and length
** Similarity to existing campaigns (is it unique, truly original?)
** group campaigns by type and display the visualization by type of campaings
** one option is to build an analytical tool for fund raisers to track their campaigns
